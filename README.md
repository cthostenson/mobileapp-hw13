# Xamarin.Forms demo app using Marvel Comics API

This app was developed to demostrate building native iOS and Android mobile apps with the Xamarin platform and the Xamarin.Forms toolkit. It also demonstrate basic use of the MVVM pattern using Xamarin.Forms. I use this demo app in most of my Xamarin.Forms and MVVM talks at .NET and mobile user groups, code camps and other community events.

The sample data used in this app is provided by Marvel via the Marvel Comics API. For more information about the Marvel Comics API and how to use it visit [developer.marvel.com](http://developer.marvel.com).
